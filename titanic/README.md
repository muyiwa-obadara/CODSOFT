___
This problems involves classifying an unknown flower as  Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica.
There are 150 flower instances whose features were observed. The features observed were:
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Sepal length
- Sepal width

Classification algorithms was used to develope a model which tries to identify a new flower instances whose metrics was supplied. The KNN was trained on the dataset but the result was not satisfactory.

With the Support Vector Machine using a "linear" kernel and a value of C equal to 0.05, a modell with an accuracy of 95% and above was achieved.
